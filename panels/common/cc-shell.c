 * @short_description: Interface representing the Control Center shell
 *
 * CcShell is an interface that represents an instance of a control
 * center shell. It provides access to some of the properties of the shell
 * that panels will need to read or change. When a panel is created it has an
 * instance of CcShell available that represents the current shell.
