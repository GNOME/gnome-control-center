# These are the people responsible for Settings panels and domain-specific
# parts of the GNOME Settings codebase.

# If you open a merge request for files listed here, please add the following
# people to the list of reviewers.

# The syntax of this file is defined by GitLab:
#   https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html
# Which, in turn, is similar to the .gitignore and .gitattributes files:
#
#  - comments start with `#`
#  - the first column contains paths and globs
#  - the second column contains GitLab user names or email addresses,
#    separated by spaces
#
# The last matching glob (rather than the union of *all* matching globs) gives
# the owners of a piece of code.
#
# If you want to be responsible for code reviews in specific sections of
# the GNOME Settings code base, add yourself here.
