	reviewed by: Jacob Berkman <jacob@ximian.com>
	
	Added a new interface so that capplets that do direct manipulation
	of parameters can work in the control center environment.  Without
	this interface, the control-center assumes that changes made
	are lost when the control-center is closed.  The control center
	also enables the Try and Revert button which do not apply
	to an immediate change capplet that has no rollback state.
	
	* idl/control-center.idl:
	Add new changes_are_imediate interface

	* control-center/capplet-widget-libs.c: (do_quit),
	(capplet_corba_gtk_main_quit),

	translations.

2001-1-16  Mike Engber  <engber@eazel.com> 

	* capplets/background-properties/render-background.c: We were
	leaking x-server memory. The test before the call to XKillClient,
	nitems == 4, always failed. It should have been nitems == 1. Also,
	we now free the ptr returned by XGetWindowProperty whenever it's
	not NULL - previously we were never freeing it because of the
	aforementioned problem, but in general, it needs to always be
	freed. Also, we now examine the return value from XGetWindowProperty
	before using its results.

Wed Jan 03 04:15:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* capplets/background-properties/render-background.c: Do what the
	  comment says and create a new display connection.  Otherwise all
	  resources get leaked to the root, and not just the root pixmap
	  as intended.  Imlib pixmap cache should make leaking all resources
	  even a more memorable experience.

2000-11-23  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

           capplets (e.g. wm-properties) do their preference saving in

	 - Doesn't call gdk_property_get() with the arguments in 
	   the wrong order.
